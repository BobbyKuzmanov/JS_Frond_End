// Write a function that determines whether a driver is within the speed limit. 
// You will receive the speed and the area. Each area has a different limit: 
//     • On the motorway, the limit is 130 km/h
//     • On the interstate, the limit is 90 km/h
//     • In the city, the limit is 50 km/h 
//     • Within a residential area, the limit is 20 km/h
// If the driver is within the limits, there should be a printed speed and the speed limit. 
//                 `Driving {speed} km/h in a {speed limit} zone`
// If the driver is over the limit, however, your function should print the severity
//  of the infraction and the difference in speeds. 
// `The speed is {difference} km/h faster than the allowed speed of {speed limit} - {status}`
// For speeding up to 20 km/h over the limit, the status should be speeding.
// For speeding up to 40 km/h over the limit, the status should be excessive speeding.
// For anything else, status should be reckless driving.
// The input comes as 2 string parameters. The first element is the current speed (number),
// the second element is the area.
// The output should be printed on the console.
