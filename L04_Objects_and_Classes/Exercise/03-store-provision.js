// You will receive two arrays. The first array represents the current
//  stock of the local store. The second array will contain products 
//  that the store has ordered for delivery.
// The following information applies to both arrays:
// Every even index will hold the name of the product and every odd 
// index will hold the quantity of that product. The second array could 
// contain products that are already in the local store. If that happens 
// increase the quantity for the given product. You should store them into
//  an object, and print them in the following format: (product -> quantity)
// All of the arraysâ€™ values will be strings.
